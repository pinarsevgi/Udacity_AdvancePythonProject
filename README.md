# Overview
At a high-level, you'll create Python code that implements a command-line tool to inspect and query a dataset of NEOs and their close approaches to Earth.

Concretely, you'll have to read data from both a CSV file and a JSON file, convert that data into structured Python objects, perform filtering operations on the data, limit the size of the result set, and write the results to a file in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON.

When complete, you'll be able to inspect the properties of the near-Earth objects in the data set and query the data set of close approaches to Earth using any combination of the following filters:

* Occurs on a given date.
* Occurs on or after a given start date.
* Occurs on or before a given end date.
* Approaches Earth at a distance of at least (or at most) X astrononical units.
* Approaches Earth at a relative velocity of at least (or at most) Y kilometers per second.
* Has a diameter that is at least as large as (or at least as small as) Z kilometers.
* Is marked by NASA as potentially hazardous (or not).
# Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you'll have demonstrated an ability to:

* Represent structured data in Python.
* Extract data from structured files into Python.
* Transform the data within Python according to some desired behavior.
* Save the results in a structured way to a file.
Along the way, you'll have to be able to:

Write Python functions to transform data and perform algorithms.
* Design Python classes to encapsulate useful data types.
* Provide interface abstractions for complex implementations.
It's normal to encounter bugs along the way, so in all likelihood, you'll also gain practice with valuable debugging skills, whether interpreting stack traces, chasing down system errors, handling and raising appropriate errors, walking through code with pdb, checking preconditions with assert, or simply displaying internal state with print.
